# Introduction

Marriage is such a big topic in human life and always a very strong predictor of people's life satisfaction and happiness level. However, not all marriages are eternal happy endings and a lot of them nowadays end in divorce. If we can understand the factors that influence the quality of marriage, we may be able to discover more preventive measures to help more people maintain a lifelong happy marriage.

To answer this question, our group examined the 2011 UK Census data and limited our scope to the marital status of a sample of British people. 

through descriptive and inferential statistics

To clarify, we define divorce rate here as (total number of divorce or separated)/(total number of marriage). Thus, we exclude all people who have not yet married, and the people who end their marriages out of other reasons such as the other partner's death.  



## Description
The dataset we examined is the 5% sample data of the 2011 UK Census. It contains 2,848,155 observations and 121 variables. Each observation represents a UK citizen
Since the dataset is very large and there are too many variables, we decided to exclusively focus on the relationship between marital status (marstat) and other variables. In brief, we would like to examine the factors that may influence people's marriage and lead to higher divorce rate. Therefore, we selected a total of 17 variables that may be highly correlated with marital status.


We can attach a table of all variables we examined here:

# Descriptive Statistics and Correlation Tests
Simple descriptive statistis including bar charts, pie charts, density graph... etc. 
We can show a few correlation tests, chi-squre tests and graphs

## Social and Economic Status & Marriage 



## Religion and Culture & Marriage



## Age & Marriage



## Region/Geography & Marriage
An article on divorce rate by region piqued our interests (http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-3201497/Wish-weren-t-ten-divorce-hot-spots-Britain-sea-Blackpool-worst-place-live-want-happy-marriage.html). The article lists the top 10 divorce hot spots and they are all coastal cities. In this paper we are keen to explore whether our data attests to the findings of that article. 

The data shows a significant peak in inner London which shows that the percentage of people in bad marriage (either divorced or separated) is much higher than elsewhere. We would like to conduct a hypothesis testing to see if region and marital status are independent. The test we adopt here is chi-squared test at 5% significance level because we are exploring the correlations between two categorical variables. 

The p-value is less than 5% and it means that the we can reject the null hypothesis that region and marital status are independent. From the residuals of chi-squared test, we see that married couples are greatly underrepresented in Inner London, but divorced and separated couples are over represented. Interestingly Inner London has a very high proportion of same-sex couples. 

We use the data to plot a mosaic plot which essentially represents the residual table graphically. 

```{r, echo = FALSE}
# select the data relevant for region
region1 <- dplyr:: select(fd, binary_marstat, age, aggdtwpew11g, region, marstat, transport, wpzhome, Highest_qualification, binary_region_factor, binary_region_num,hours, tenure)

region_count<- region1 %>% select(marstat, region) %>% group_by(region, marstat)%>% summarise(count = n())%>% tidyr::spread(key = marstat, value = count) %>% mutate(divorce_rate = (Divorced + Separated)/(Divorced + Married + Separated))

# plot divorce rate for region
region1%>% group_by(region) %>% summarise(divorce_rate = mean(binary_marstat))%>% ggplot(aes(x = region, y = divorce_rate))+ geom_col() + theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 30, hjust = 1))

# chi-squared test
region_test <- region_count[,-1]
rownames(region_test) <- as.data.frame(region_count)[,1]
chi_region <- chisq.test(as.data.frame(region_test))
chi_region
round(chi_region$residuals, 3)
```


We further perform t-test to compare the divorce rate of Inner London and all the other regions. Inner London has a divorce rate of approximately 25%, higher than the average of 20% across all regions. The difference is statistically significant. 


```{r region_ttest, echo = FALSE}
t.test(fd$binary_marstat, fd$binary_marstat[fd$region == "Inner London"])
```

```{r, echo = FALSE, eval = FALSE}
#mean_London <- fdata$binary_marstat[fdata$region == "Inner London"]
outside_london <- fd$binary_marstat[fd$region != "Inner London"]

t.test(outside_london, fd$binary_marstat[fd$region == "North East"])
t.test(outside_london, fd$binary_marstat[fd$region == "North West"])
t.test(outside_london, fd$binary_marstat[fd$region == "Yorkshire and the Humber"])
t.test(outside_london, fd$binary_marstat[fd$region == "East Midlands"])
t.test(outside_london, fd$binary_marstat[fd$region == "West Midlands"])
t.test(outside_london, fd$binary_marstat[fd$region == "East of England"])
t.test(outside_london, fd$binary_marstat[fd$region == "Outer London"])
t.test(outside_london, fd$binary_marstat[fd$region == "South East"])
t.test(outside_london, fd$binary_marstat[fd$region == "South West"])
t.test(outside_london, fd$binary_marstat[fd$region == "Wales"])

```

The article aforementioned states that the factors contributing to the high divorce rate in coastal regions are due to the high deprivation and possibly sheer boredoem in winter. Our data shows otherwise. London is anything but a deprived and boring city. We doubt the place people choose to live could affect their marriage satisfaction, however it could be an artifact as a result of distributions of other influencing factors. We plot the divorce rates against other variables in our list and wrap them by region. If region has no impact, we should observe the same pattern across all regions, with London having a slightly higher divorce rate. 

Findings: we observe a significantly high divorce rate for people aged 50 and above in Inner London. However Inner London is a very young city with mean age of residents at around 47, and median age 45 (population mean and median are both 52). To explore it further we break down the population into two groups: age below 50 and age 50 and above. In the first group we no longer see any significant difference in divorce rates across regions, but the difference becomes more apparent in the second group. The observation suggests a larger proportion of people aged 50 and above are divorced or separated in Inner London than elsewhere. 

According to Office for National Statistics in their online publication in July 2017, while the number of divorces drop by 28% from 2005 to 2015, the number of men divorcing aged above 65 went up by 23% and 38% for women.  (https://visual.ons.gov.uk/marriage-and-divorce-on-the-rise-at-65-and-over/). 

Various factors contribute to the increasing divorce rate among older people (Susan L. Brown and I-Fen Lin 18 Oct 2012, https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3478728/). A better economic security, and more social interactions with people are among them. In their research, they found a positive association between full-time employment and divorce, but more pronounced among women; likewise for income and divorce for women. We replicated their research but couldn't find any significant difference between men and women in these associations. More significanty observed in their data is that people in higher order marriages are more likely to end up in divorces than people in first marriage (53.46% compared to 46.54%). And people in their 50s and 60s are also more likely to be in higher order marriages compared to younger people. 

However we must be careful not to confuse the status of being divorced or separated with the instance of getting a divorce. In our data we look at the percentage of people who are divorced or separated at the time of the survey, without information on when and where the divorce occured. It could also be possible that people in inner London are less likely to remarry after they are divorced, just like London has the highest percentage of singles aged 30 and above. London is fun and people could be just having a good time living alone or cohabitating, without rushing into any marriage.

### Dependent children

When people get married they are often in love and happy, most married couples look forward parenthood and having children could even strengthen their marital bond. However empirical study shows that the effect of children on marital stability could be very complex. Children increase the stability of marriage when they are young (Waite, Linda and Lee 1991); the greater number of children, the smaller possibility of divorce, but the relationship is inversely quadratic rather than linear suggesting the stabilizing effect is the strongest with the first and second child (Xu, Yu and Qiu 2015). One explanation for this is that experiencing divorce often place young children at risk for a variety of problems, which may persist into adulthood (Morrisox and Coiro, 1999). Married couples may choose to stay in marriges for the wellbeing of their children but when children are old enough they decide to part their ways.

## Health & Marriage
```{r message = FALSE, warning = FALSE, echo = FALSE}
#This should be made universal and not distinct to any one local machine
mine <- select(fd, disability, marstat, binary_marstat)

mine$disability <- factor(mine$disability, levels = c(1,2,3), labels = c("Limit a lot", "Limit a little", "not limited") )
mine$binary_marstat <- factor(mine$binary_marstat, levels = c(0,1), labels = c("married", "divorced"))
chisq.test(mine$binary_marstat,mine$disability)

```

A chi-square test of the two variables indicate that the correlation between marital status and long-term health problem is significant. This finding suggests that the two variables are not independent of each other. Long-term health problem will influence marital status. 

```{r echo = FALSE}
mine2 <- select(fd, disability, marstat, binary_marstat)
mine2$disability <- factor(mine2$disability, levels = c(1,2,3), labels = c("Limit a lot", "Limit a little", "not limited") )
mine2 <- mine2 %>% group_by(disability) %>% summarise(divorce_rate = mean(binary_marstat))
ggplot(mine, aes(disability, fill =binary_marstat))+geom_bar(position = "fill")
ggplot(mine2, aes(disability, divorce_rate))+geom_bar(stat = "identity")
```
The graph shows that the less severe the long-term health problem, the less the divorced rate.
